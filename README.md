Material for my lecture on Distributed Ledger Technology

## Notebooks

This repository contains interactive notebooks on distributed ledger technology topics:

- Original Jupyter notebooks are in the `work/` directory
- Marimo notebooks are available in the `book/marimo/` directory

To run the marimo notebooks, use the `marimo edit` or `marimo run` commands.
